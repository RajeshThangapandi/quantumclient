# Angular App Setup

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js**: Angular requires Node.js for running the development server and for building the project. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm**: Node.js comes with npm (Node Package Manager). Ensure it's installed by running `npm -v` in your terminal.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine. Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of your Angular project.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>

npm install
ng serve
